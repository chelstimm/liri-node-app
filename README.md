# LIRI Bot

## Overview

LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.
You will be able to use LIRI like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface.

LIRI will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.

This app uses different Node packages to retrieve the data.
1. Spotify
2. Axios
3. Moment.js
4. Dotenv 

### Instructions

You may use one of the following commands to retreive the data you're wanting:

   * node liri.js concert-this <artist/band name here> *

   * node liri.js movie-this <movie name here> *

   * node liri.js do-what-it-says *

These commands will output the following information to your terminal/bash window.
